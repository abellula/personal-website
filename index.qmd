## Welcome to my Website!
### About Me

I recently graduated with a Bachelor's Degree at University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), majoring in Statistics and Data Science. Prior to transferring to UCLA, I attained my AS in Mathematics at El Camino College. Right now, I am currently looking for work in the data science industry, particularly in sports.
